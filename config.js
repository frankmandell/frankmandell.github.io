            description: 'January 14, 2020, Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, an investment Bank headquarter in New York, writes a letter to “CEO”.  The letter is directed towards the CEO’s of all companies insides of BlackRock’s Investment portfolio.  These letters have become famous for shaping global financial and business practices, by using threat of divestment as their catalyst. “Climate change has become a defining factor in companies’ long-term prospects. Last September, when millions of people took to the streets to demand action on climate change, many of them emphasized the significant and lasting impact that it will have on economic growth and prosperity – a risk that markets to date have been slower to reflect. But awareness is rapidly changing, and I believe we are on the edge of a fundamental reshaping of finance.The evidence on climate risk is compelling investors to reassess core assumptions about modern finance. Research from a wide range of organizations – including the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the BlackRock Investment Institute, and many others, including new studies from McKinsey on the socioeconomic implications of physical climate risk – is deepening our understanding of how climate risk will impact both our physical world and the global system that finances economic growth.” - Larry Fink',
